 Ali Khan's Portfolio 

  I am a first-year student at CSUF studying computer engineering. 

  ## Favorite Labs from this semester: 

* Lab 11 Part 1: 

  Lab 11 was my favorite lab because I learned a lot about using classes and working with a large dataset of states, including their population and land area. I found it fascinating how we could break down such a large list into manageable pieces using the code we wrote. For example, I liked how we could extract the population of a state with a line like int population = std::stoi(row.at(2));. It was a cool and practical way to work with real-world data.

* Lab 10:

  This was one of my favorite labs because it gave me a deeper understanding of working with data structures and extracting meaningful insights. The AllCountiesString function was particularly satisfying to implement as it concatenates all county names into a single string, creating a clear overview of the data. I also enjoyed writing CountyPopulation and StatePopulation because they involved logical thinking to extract specific details and calculate totals, making the code feel both functional and efficient.

* Lab 7: 

  For this lab personally, I didnâ€™t like it, but it was my best-performing lab. I did a lot when it came to doing this lab. Due to me pretty much doing this entire thing, I learned from it. The introduction with if-else statements was very interesting, and even though it was technically the same format as doing if else in other statements  I sucked when doing it at first, but over time got a lot better with it.
